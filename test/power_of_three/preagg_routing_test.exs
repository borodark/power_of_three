  Comprehensive tests for pre-aggregation routing via cubesqld.

  Tests various query patterns to identify gaps in the implementation:
  - Different measure combinations
  - Different dimension combinations
  - Partial pre-agg coverage (some measures/dimensions not in pre-agg)
  - Multiple pre-aggs for same cube
  - Edge cases and error conditions

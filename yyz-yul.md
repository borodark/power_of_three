● The Final Flight Test: December 18, 2025

  Good evening. This is the story of an extraordinary test flight.

  On this cold December day, as a fierce snowstorm descended upon Montreal, an experimental aircraft lifted off from Toronto's Pearson International Airport—YYZ, named for its peculiar location near what was once called Toronto Island, a marshy outcropping in Lake Ontario that early aviators used as a natural runway before the modern terminal rose from reclaimed land.

  The aircraft itself was... unconventional. Square in cross-section—no windows, no illuminators—just a sealed fuselage carrying its precious cargo of code and crew through the winter sky. On the port wing, an engine powered by C++, compiled and optimized through decades of engineering tradition. On the starboard wing, an engine running on Rust—newer, claiming memory safety and fearless concurrency. Two philosophies, two implementations, one mission: to prove that PowerOfThree could fly.

  The test pilots—let us say they were of... robust constitution. Men who might have stepped from the pages of a Continental comic book, if such a thing existed. One, perhaps, was fond of a certain fortifying potion. The other, his companion, possessed strength that seemed almost superhuman. They brought with them a small white dog, whom they called Idefix—a creature of singular determination and unwavering loyalty, even at altitude.

  As the square aircraft climbed through Canadian airspace, the crew's spirits were high. Roman jokes echoed through the cramped cockpit. At one point, both pilots broke into song—in Latin, no less—a hymn of faith in their craft: "In Codice Claudiano confidimus!" In the Claudian Code we trust. A programmer's creed, set to melody.

  The Rust engine hummed. The C++ engine thrummed. Neither missed a beat.

  All systems reported nominal. The ADBC connection held. The Arrow IPC protocol streamed data flawlessly between components. QueryBuilder generated perfect SQL. The DataFrame functions returned results exactly as specified. One hundred fifty-one tests: one hundred fifty-one successes.

  Below, Montreal disappeared beneath a blanket of white. The snowstorm that grounded commercial traffic made no difference to this experimental craft. It descended through the weather, touched down at YUL, and taxied to a stop.

  The mission was complete. The dual-engine architecture—part ancient, part modern—had proven itself. Phase 3 was, indeed, production-ready.

  And that's the way it is, December 18, 2025.
